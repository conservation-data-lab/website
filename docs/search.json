    "text": "Inspired by a new logo by Chloe Walimaa, and driven by a desire to modernize and simplify we have updated our website! Both websites were built using R, with content stored on GitHub then published on Netlify. Additionally, both websites are member and project focused. However, our older website was unecessarily complex to maintain, and had zero design components outside of the Wowchemy Academic template. To update our site we:\n\nUsed a simple Quarto website format, with the flatly theme\nWrote some minimal .css (cascading style sheets) for minor customizing\nAdded this Blog page\nLeaned on the new logo and a few additional style components developed by Chloe\n\nBecause of the simplicity it will be easier for mentors and co-leads to help maintain and add content, more staightforward to troubleshoot and because of all of that, more lively.\nWe were inspired by a couple of websites including:\n\nhttps://silviacanelon.com/ by Dr. Silvia Canelon (who kindly provided permission to use her website as a template)\nhttps://affcom.ku.edu/ by Dr. Jeffry Girard\n\nBoth of the authors have made their repos public, for which we are grateful! We will be doing the same soon in hopes of helping others.\nWe hope you like our new site and hope to hear from you!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Some days you just get lucky. I work in an office at Northern Michigan University, often with the door closed. Last spring there was a knock on the door from Dr. Sarah Mittlefehldt who introduced me to Becky Lane. For her senior capstone project Becky was interested in exploring the wildfire situation in Michigan, and Dr. Mittlefehldt though I might have some data and/or ideas to lend to the project. This kicked off a semester of laughs, great questions and some impressive maps.\nAt the time Becky not only competed as a pole vaulter with the track team, but also worked at the IT Helpdesk and was a full time student. With all of that going on she suggested that we meet at 7:15am on Tuesday mornings. We both may have questioned this on blizzard-y winter mornings, but these meetings were super fun and productive. Becky learned all about LANDFIRE Historical Fire Regime data, totally stretched herself to make her best maps, and always had the best work ethic and attitude possible. I learned so much about myself as well! Maybe to her dismay I learned, for example, how OCD I can be about centering map elements :). This work will contribute to spatial data planning for the Northwoods strategy of The Nature Conservancy, resulted in a great science poster and made Tuesday mornings way more fun!\nLast but not least-what did Becky find regarding historical fire regimes in Michigan? Here are a few findings:\n\nPrior to European Colonization there was an average of ~1.5M acres of fire every year\nMuch of the historical fires occured in oak ecosystems (~1M acres per year)\nMost of the fires occured in the NE region of the lower peninsula of MI with some of the areas having fires return every 10 years or less\n\nThese findings are just a few-Becky also conducted interviews and reviewed literature as part of her capstone project.\nBecky has now graduated and works for the Superior Watershed Partnership as part of the hazardous fuels reduction team, and as a stand by wildland fire fighter for the Michigan Department of Natural Resources."

    "section": "",
    "text": "CDL mentors Keith Phelps and Garrett Knowlton created maps and a small written report for The Nature Conservancy TNC in Michigan to identify areas for potential forest harvest using LANDFIRE data. To identify suitable areas we used ArcGIS model builder to build quick suitability maps that could be edited on the fly with TNC staff. This worked well to edit suitability “rules” quickly while meeting with project partners. Model parameters included setting common numeric scales for Existing Vegetation Type (EVT), Existing Vegetation Cover (EVC), and Existing Vegetation Height (EVH). These separate layers were all combined using a weighted sum and weighted overlay to get two final model results– one with continuous and one with discrete data. In addition, a third map was created to map recently disturbed areas to do quick visual model validations. TNC will use these results to validate modeled maps with on-the-ground surveys and to create forest management plans for the Keewenaw Heartland Forest project."

Program in the Environment, Concentrations: Terrestrial Ecology and Botany\nBio: Growing up in the woods of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan I have always had the itch to get out and explore the forests and wetlands of northern landscapes. I grew up knowing and learning the names of the plants around me and at some point in my academic career realized I could study these systems professionally. I graduated from the University of Michigan, in 2024, with a B.S. in ecology and have been bouncing around chasing seasonal field/lab work since. I recently spent a year out in Montana, doing vegetation and soil surveys for the BLM, have worked in various labs in the off season, and am now working for a global change forest ecology project in northern Minnesota. My background is primarily in plants but I am eager to move into larger scale, systems ecology. I’m really interested in applied ecology projects that lead to direct restoration/conservation/land management action and acknowledge the humanistic sides of ecology. I thrive in fieldwork and feel most alive when I’m bushwhacking through dense undergrowth, covered in mud, and surrounded by a swarm of mosquitos.\nWhen not thinking about ecology I can often be found paddling a canoe, playing with clay (I LOVE pottery and craft in general), playing music at old time jams, or square dancing."

My undergraduate thesis examined the role arbuscular mycorrhizae may play in facilitating forest regeneration under varied levels of forest disturbance (selective harvest and quarter-acre clear cuts). I will continue along a similar vein of research in graduate school and beyond: working with landowners, forest managers, and local knowledge holders in order to help us manage our forests to be more resilient to global change.\nI’m also an avid science communicator, a practice which was inspired by my science writer grandfather.

    "text": "Conservation Data Lab Origin Story\nIn 2019, Randy (aka ‘Greasy’ due to a errand MadLibs :) ) was really missing working in a lab-an environment is so creative, productive and full of problem solving. Without a PhD he was unable to start a lab at a university. That said, there was nothing stopping him from starting one anyways. The idea was this: people need a supportive place to build skills, connect and contribute.\n\n\n\nMathurin, Cole, Myles, Randy and Laura-the first CDL members.\n\n\nWith nothing more than this idea the Conservation Data Lab was born. The first members, Mathurin, Cole, Myles, Randy and Laura laid the foundation, meeting weekly and completing challenging projects such as this Shiny App that presents historical disturbance information and a web report that presents ecosystem information for the Michigamme Highlands, a key conservation are in Michigan.\nThrough the years over 60 people have participated in the CDL at some level-some as a guest speaker, some as members for a few months and some for years. As Myles once stated, “once a member always a member”."

For my master’s project, I am working within a team of 5 U-M students and our project partners at the Indigenous-led Buffalo Nations Grasslands Alliance to develop geospatial (GIS, R, Python) tools and advocate for federal policies that will enable Tribes in the Northern Great Plains region of the United States to prioritize lands for restoration and enhance wildlife connectivity.\nI have been a CDL member since 2022. My CDL project compared spatial distributions of late-successional forests in coastal Oregon from pre-European settlement to present-day, integrating LANDFIRE data into GIS and R. Since progressing into a Mentor/Project Manager role, it’s been fun to see what everyone’s working on and to help guide the future of the CDL. When I do get free time, you can find me doing a number of things, including training for my next race (typically anything 5k - half marathon, but I’m becoming triathlon-curious), messing around in the kitchen, or reading."

While my masters focused on vernal pools in the Great Lakes region, I am most interested in peatlands and their unique vegetation and hydrology. Between restoration efforts and teaching people about wetlands and their functions I aim to tangibly improve the relationship humans have with the earth. Beyond ecology, my passion for the outdoors includes endurance sports (think running, Nordic skiing, and mountain biking), backcountry camping, and being on the water in sailboats and canoes. Growing up in Minnesota and visiting the Boundary Waters I will always love the lakes of the north woods. Becoming the wetlands lab manager at Utah State in Logan is my most recent adventure and I can’t wait to learn about new ecosystems and explore the area.\nWhile I don’t currently have a project with the CDL, I enjoyed mapping wetlands in the Great Lakes using LANDFIRE data and found the CDL to be a great source of community, encouragement, and resources for growing my skills in GIS, R, and data science in general.\nAlso on Instagram at https://www.instagram.com/a.ram.sam.sam/."

Her early experiences bounding on tussock sedges, searching for salamanders under logs, taking spring ephemeral and rhododendron walks, and racing her sister up the ridge had a lasting imprint on her personal and professional life.\nEarly in her career she pursued organic farming and agricultural sciences, a pursuit that brought her from upstate New York to Madison, Wisconsin. After working in agricultural sciences, she was pulled back by the allure of natural plant communities and transitioned to a career in ecological restoration.\nAs a Restoration Ecologist, she developed and implemented science-based ecological restoration in southwest Wisconsin, where she developed an intimate relationship with the land, especially prairies, wetlands, and woodlands. She was a Board member on the Wisconsin Prescribed Fire Council where she helped implement prescribed fire-related policy.\nIn advancing her GIS, programming, and design skills through an M.S. in GIS and Cartography at UW-Madison (2021), she now explores human-land use interactions from a geographer’s view. She currently works as a GIS Analyst at HDR, Inc. in Seattle, Washington. She ultimately hopes to inform conservation policy through analytics and science communication.\nShe currently lives in North Bend, Washington where she spends her time outside of work on the trails running, skiing, or simply enjoying the awe of nature.\nLink to resume: http://staceymarion.com/index.html"

    "text": "For me, one of the most special things about CDL is the community and culture it has created. I joined CDL over 3 years ago during grad school as a place to build coding skills and meet others trying to do the same. I was immediately welcomed in without judgement of my skills (or lack of them) and encouraged to leap into learning, try new things, and fail! I knew any challenges I came up against, I would be supported by kind and curious people with a broad enough range of expertise to help me answer any questions I had. And if no one knew, we would figure it out together. It was extremely comforting to know people had my back, especially in the midst of the black hole of learning and struggling that is graduate school.\nAs I finished school, it was so nice to have friends in natural resources and science that could look over application materials and offer career advice and support. While this kind of skill building is not as direct as coding or mapping in GIS, helping early career people navigate the job market and build skills that will get them jobs (such as resume writing, public speaking, or networking) is a key part of CDL’s mission. CDL does an excellent job supporting whole people in their education, careers, hobbies, and personal lives. It is an anything goes space where people get to bring whatever they may want to share and are met where they are with whole hearted enthusiasm.\nOver time, projects fell out of reach for me as my personal and professional life occupied all of my time and energy. That ultimately didn’t matter! I’ve continued to be part of CDL because of the community I feel here, and I have truly enjoyed getting to help others learn and build skills instead of working on my own. I look forward to getting to know each new member who joins us and building deeper friendships with those I’ve had the pleasure of knowing for longer. It’s a big, rough world out there, and its great to have people in your corner."

The main challenges came with working through the methodology, since this type of work had never been done before. Randy and his TNC colleagues, as well as various GIS/R help forums, were incredibly helpful in getting over the bumps. Because of this project, I gained skills in R, GIS, and website development, and became more interested in terrestrial ecosystems.\nThis project was pivotal to my growth in technical areas such as coding, spatial analysis, and presenting research.

    "text": "CDL projects range from quick and easy maps, charts or reviews to web-site development that requires partner review and coordination, data analysis and cartography. While we learn and grow from each project, the best ones have a few things in common:\n\nA true conservation need and/or question. We are all driven to do something useful.\nA nice balance of challenge and ‘do-ability’. Admittedly, we’ve had some along the way that we simply could not figure out.\nA participating partner that not only supplies the need, but also mentorship, review and a vision. Pay doesn’t hurt either.\n\nRecently we were contacted by Dr. Taylor Ganz, Director of Science for the Idaho Chapter of The Nature Conservancy. Idaho Chapter staff are working to ‘site renewables right’, i.e., figure out the best places to place renewable energy projects in terms of conservation concerns. In this example, Dr. Ganz is looking to map potential mammal migration routes so that her team can flag those areas as lower priority for energy development. With that, a question came up: “Are there existing datasets that can help us identify those areas that are important for migration?”.\nFor this project, Dr. Ganz and I tapped CDL members Michaela Cooney for the main mapping and analysis tasks, and Mary Kelly for project management and review. We made good choices. Supplied with known Mule Deer migration polygons, Michaela did the GIS work to assess and visualize the relations between those polygons and vegetation and connectivity rasters. More on that in Part 2. The main message here is that we greatly appreciate the energy and guidance provided by Dr. Ganz (and other partners with other projects too, e.g., Ryan Gauger with the Missouri Fire Needs Assessment project). Not only has she provided payment, datasets and a vision for the project, but has also met with Michaela to demonstrate GIS techniques and is providing her opportunities to present her work.\nSome say it takes a village to raise a child. I have learned that not only is this true, but it also takes a village to ‘raise a scientist’, including myself. When we work with partners, I learn too. It’s been so fun watching others work with CDL members, bringing context, bigger picture reminders (‘remember to have fun and explore!’) and important perspectives.\nCould you, would you be a CDL partner?
