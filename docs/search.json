    "text": "Biography\nMary graduated from Northern Michigan University (NMU), double-majoring in Environmental Science (natural resources emphasis) and French. Entering her final year of college, Mary leads two NMU student organizations, is an alumna of the NMU Student Leader Fellowship Program, and has interned in the federal government and non-profit conservation spaces. In the CDL, Mary mapped old growth forests in Oregon, looking at Biophysical Settings and historical tree data to determine which areas could have been classified as old growth if not for certain circumstances. Her favorite part of the CDL is being part of a community of people who care for the well-being of the environment. Fall of 2024 Mary entered the University of Michigan as a Master’s Degree student in GIS and data analytics."

    "text": "Biography\nI am a final year undergraduate completing a degree in Physical Geography and International Relations from the University of St Andrews/University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. With my degree and professional experience I have focused on the intersection of geospatial analysis and policy, particularly where GIS and remote sensing can improve on existing data and devise new ways of visualizing pressing global and local concerns such as the effects of climate change. Currently I am finalizing a dissertation using remote sensing techniques to examine the land use change and population displacement effects of large-scale land acquisitions in Madagascar. When not deep in research and essays, I can variously be found salsa-ing or slogging up a Scottish hill. But kayaking ultimately has my heart and the past three summers have all been spent on Lake Superior, paddling in one capacity or another."

I use ecological knowledge and programming expertise to assist natural resource professionals seeking the best data to support their work. I routinely lead problem-solving and data exploration sessions and demonstrates the power of leadership and coordination through a wide professional network. My work has ranged from supporting mycorrhizal fungi experts to map potential fungal communities (see Swaty et al., 2016) to developing a template for forest professionals to follow when preparing for forest certification audits. My accomplishments include the publication of multiple peer-reviewed publications and participation in numerous professional presentations but most of all, I enjoy connecting with natural resource professionals and helping them find ways to best leverage the power of ecological data to advance and amplify their work."

    "section": "Biography",
    "text": "Biography\nEmily moved to Michigan’s Upper Peninsula in 2012 for college and fell in love with Lake Superior. Throughout her undergraduate career Emily was a McNair Scholar, president of Sun and Pine Nature Club, and an active participant of the Minnesota Dragonfly Society. As a Master’s student, Emily enjoyed teaching biology labs to undergraduate students and spent many, many hours peering through a microscope wrangling rotifers. Emily worked for The National Park Service as biological science and fisheries technicians at Isle Royale National Park for three summer seasons. For her doctoral work, Emily is investigating the impacts of moose browse and wildfire on soil and vegetation communities at Isle Royale National Park. Another component of her work will include using GIS to examine the role insect pests (e.g., spruce budworm and satin moth) play in the disturbance regime at Isle Royale.\nWhen she is not working on academic projects, she loves self-propelled long distance travel (thru hiking, paddling big miles by canoe), spending mornings in the kitchen baking for a crowd, time with her cat Meera, and playing cribbage with her partner Dan."
