After graduating from UW Madison in History and Environmental Studies, Keith worked in the private sector of ecological restoration in the greater Madison and Driftless Region of WI. Here he gained an appreciation for plant conservation, prescribed fire, invasive species management, and urban restoration projects. After working in the UW-Arboretum Longnecker Horticultural gardens, Keith received his MS in Forest Resources at Clemson University. His research focused on developing GIS land suitability models for mechanized timber harvesting and prescribed fire restoration in the Southern Blue Ridge Escarpment of SC. Following completion of his Master’s degree Keith focused on ecological restoration and wetland delineation/determination in Mt. Horeb, WI and continues to research forest restoration and management with GIS applications. Recently, Keith began work as a WOrking Lands Forestry Educator with the Wisconsin Natural Resources Institute of the University of Wisconsin Extension program.\nIn his free time, Keith enjoys running, making music, writing poetry, and going for hikes in the Baraboo Hills of WI."

Emily worked for The National Park Service as biological science and fisheries technicians at Isle Royale National Park for three summer seasons. For her doctoral work, Emily is investigating the impacts of moose browse and wildfire on soil and vegetation communities at Isle Royale National Park. Another component of her work will include using GIS to examine the role insect pests (e.g., spruce budworm and satin moth) play in the disturbance regime at Isle Royale.\nWhen she is not working on academic projects, she loves self-propelled long distance travel (thru hiking, paddling big miles by canoe), spending mornings in the kitchen baking for a crowd, time with her cat Meera, and playing cribbage with her partner Dan."

The idea was this: people need a supportive place to build skills, connect and contribute.\n\n\n\nMathurin, Cole, Myles, Randy and Laura-the first CDL members.\n\n\nWith nothing more than this idea the Conservation Data Lab was born. The first members, Mathurin, Cole, Myles, Randy and Laura laid the foundation, meeting weekly and completing challenging projects such as this Shiny App that presents historical disturbance information and a web report that presents ecosystem information for the Michigamme Highlands, a key conservation are in Michigan.\nThrough the years over 60 people have participated in the CDL at some level-some as a guest speaker, some as members for a few months and some for years.

At Dartmouth, I was a member of the Hicks Pries Soil Ecology Lab, first as a research assistant for graduate students, then as a collaborator on a literature review on litter decomposition (published by Ecology) and, finally, as an honors thesis researcher. My undergraduate thesis examined the role arbuscular mycorrhizae may play in facilitating forest regeneration under varied levels of forest disturbance (selective harvest and quarter-acre clear cuts). I will continue along a similar vein of research in graduate school and beyond: working with landowners, forest managers, and local knowledge holders in order to help us manage our forests to be more resilient to global change.\nI’m also an avid science communicator, a practice which was inspired by my science writer grandfather.

    "text": "Biography\n“Growing up in the Great Lakes state, freshwater seas were a significant part of my upbringing. Most of my life was spent learning and exploring just outside of Detroit, MI. Though, my parents took my sister and I camping “up north” every summer where we were able to play in the forests and on the beaches. After obtaining my Associate’s degree in audio production, my dream of working in a recording studio shifted to a passion of exploring the natural world. Therefore, I moved to Marquette, MI, to the fresh coast of Lake Superior to begin my studies.\nIn Marquette, I picked up many outdoor hobbies, such as rock climbing, surfing, snowboarding, bikepacking, scuba diving, and sailing. Today, I spend my time climbing mountains to capture vistas that few people have the luxury to see. Otherwise, I spend time in the ocean waiting for the perfect wave to ride back to the shore. When I have the opportunity to pack up my bicycle with camping gear, I hit the road on a trial of endurance and discipline. Lastly, whenever I visit Lake Superior, my sister and I take our sailboat out to spend a few days finding balance between the air and the water.”"

    "text": "Biography\nStacey is an ecologist on a mission to advance conservation and land use projects using spatial analysis and visualization. She was raised in northern Connecticut where she was incredibly fortunate to grow up adjacent to a protected wetland, i.e. “the wet area”, that backed up to foothills of the Farmington Valley rift. Her early experiences bounding on tussock sedges, searching for salamanders under logs, taking spring ephemeral and rhododendron walks, and racing her sister up the ridge had a lasting imprint on her personal and professional life.\nEarly in her career she pursued organic farming and agricultural sciences, a pursuit that brought her from upstate New York to Madison, Wisconsin. After working in agricultural sciences, she was pulled back by the allure of natural plant communities and transitioned to a career in ecological restoration.\nAs a Restoration Ecologist, she developed and implemented science-based ecological restoration in southwest Wisconsin, where she developed an intimate relationship with the land, especially prairies, wetlands, and woodlands. She was a Board member on the Wisconsin Prescribed Fire Council where she helped implement prescribed fire-related policy.\nIn advancing her GIS, programming, and design skills through an M.S. in GIS and Cartography at UW-Madison (2021), she now explores human-land use interactions from a geographer’s view. She currently works as a GIS Analyst at HDR, Inc. in Seattle, Washington. She ultimately hopes to inform conservation policy through analytics and science communication.\nShe currently lives in North Bend, Washington where she spends her time outside of work on the trails running, skiing, or simply enjoying the awe of nature.\nLink to resume: http://staceymarion.com/index.html"
