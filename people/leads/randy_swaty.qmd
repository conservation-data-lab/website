## Biography
I am an Ecologist for The Nature Conservancyâ€™s LANDFIRE team and co-lead of the Conservation Data Lab. I use ecological knowledge and programming expertise to assist natural resource professionals seeking the best data to support their work. I routinely lead problem-solving and data exploration sessions and demonstrates the power of leadership and coordination through a wide professional network. My work has ranged from supporting mycorrhizal fungi experts to map potential fungal communities (see Swaty et al., 2016) to developing a template for forest professionals to follow when preparing for forest certification audits. My accomplishments include the publication of multiple peer-reviewed publications and participation in numerous professional presentations but most of all, I enjoy connecting with natural resource professionals and helping them find ways to best leverage the power of ecological data to advance and amplify their work.
