## Biography
Becky grew up in Traverse City, MI, and later chose to attend Northern Michigan University to pole vault while majoring in Environmental Studies and Sustainability, with a minor in Wildlife Conservation Law. After serving as an on-call wildland firefighter with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR), Becky developed an interest in pursuing a career in fire ecology. Becky joined CDL because Randy became her GIS mentor for her capstone project, which involved identifying high-priority areas for prescribed burns in Michigan using GIS software and historical fire management data. This project serves as a tool for future fire management decision-making. Outside of school, Becky enjoys hiking, swimming, birdwatching, and climbing.
