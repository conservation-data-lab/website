## Biography
Hi! My background is in ecological restoration and conservation easement management. I’m particularly interested in how data and emerging technologies can help support both of those efforts. I started Sand River Partners as a way to provide my specific background and expertise to organizations that are trying to navigate these challenges. In my free time I love to read, go for walks, be outside, write, hang out with people I love, eat good food, and giggle.
