## Biography

I am broadly interested in landscape ecology, ecological modeling, and climate change science and adaptation. Through my research, I hope to help communities, managers, and ecosystems adapt to a changing planet. My research at UW-Madison will broadly focus on modeling future forest landscapes in the northern Rocky Mountains and the implications of changing forests for conservation and biodiversity.

In my free time I enjoy riding bicycles, fly fishing, spending time on the water in my kayak or canoe, and birding. I also enjoy live music and learning how to cook new things.
